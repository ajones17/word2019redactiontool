The tool is still installed, and if I go to \"Word Options &gt; Add-Ins\" it shows as a disabled add-in. I try clicking the button to manage add-ins and  I check the box, restart word, and the problem persists. I uninstall it, delete every related registry key with the word 'redact' in it, delete every related file/folder with the word 'redact' in it, and then re-install it. The problem persists. So far the  only way I've found to make it work again is to create a whole new windows profile and install the redaction tool again. Eventually, the add-in becomes disabled even in the new profile. &nbsp;Office 2007 on XP Pro.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I've also enabled all macros, added the subfolder the .vsto resides in to my trusted locations, enabled access to the VBA model, and basically removed any semblance of security from my Office instance. Still nothing.</p>",
