Is the any possible way to search for multiple Words at once? This because I'm looking to\r\n use it to filter out mostly swear words and negative language.</p>\r\n<p>I'd really appreciate the assistance, if any possible</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n",

Great suggestion though for future consideration.</p>",
