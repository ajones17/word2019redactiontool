<div class="wikidoc"><h3>Word 2007/2010 Redaction Tool</h3>The Word 2007&#47;2010 Redaction Tool can be used to redact text within Microsoft Office Word documents.
<h4>Overview</h4>The Word 2007/2010 Redaction tool works by allowing users to redact a document using a two stage process:
<ul><li>First, regions of text which should be redacted are marked within the document.</li>
<li>Second, the marked document is redacted, and all marked text is replaced.</li></ul>
<h4>Details</h4>The add-in adds a Redact group to Word&#39;s Review tab:<br /><img src="http://download-codeplex.sec.s-msft.com/Download?ProjectName=redaction&DownloadId=43392" alt="The&#32;Redact&#32;group&#32;in&#32;Word" title="The&#32;Redact&#32;group&#32;in&#32;Word" />
<ul><li><b>Mark</b> marks the selected content for redaction</li>
<li><b>Unmark</b> removes all redaction marks from the selected range</li>
<li><b>Next</b> moves the selection to the next redaction mark in the document (useful to see what content is marked)</li>
<li><b>Previous</b> moves the selection to the previous redaction mark in the document</li></ul>
