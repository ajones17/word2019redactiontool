    "Description": "I am attempting to install the Redaction Tool on a Windows 7 64 Ultimate N machine with Word 2010 installed.\n\nThe initial installation attempt failed.  When I attempt to re-run the installation program, the program shows the 'self extraction tool' and then, after a moment, closes.\n\nUnder 'Programs and Features' the program is not listed, nor are any programs listed as having been recently installed.\n\nI have tried running the program as administrator as well as changing the compatibility mode to WinXP, etc.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nI use the program on my laptop - still Win7 64 (but not Ultimate N) and Word 2010.\n\nAndrew",

      "Message": "I  have the same problem, only on my desktop.  I ran it from the webpage, then I downloaded it and ran it.  I turned off all my anti-virus & root kit apps, unblocked the program; all to no avail.  Maybe the app isn't really suited for Windows 7 fully updated or Office 2010.  Pity, it might have been an interesting addition to the Office site.  If there is a solution to this problem, I'd be interested it hearing about it.",
