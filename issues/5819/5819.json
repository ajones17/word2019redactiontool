Make sure nothing's in Add/Remove Programs from the reinstall attempt (sounds like not). If so, uninstall it. \r\n2. Search for vstoinstaller.exe on your hard drive (it should be in C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\microsoft shared\\VSTO\\9.0). Note that location. \r\n3. Search for *.vsto and locate the existing copy of the VSTO solution file for the add-in \r\n4. From the directory in #1, run VSTOinstaller /uninstall <path to the .vsto file> \r\n\r\nAnd then restart Word and see if the add-in is gone, that would be excellent.\r\n\r\nIf that doesn't work (no .vsto file exists, for example):\r\n\r\nCan you search for mage.exe on your machine and run mage -cc from that directory? If you don't have it, you will need to grab it from the Windows SDK from http://download.microsoft.com/.\r\n\r\nOnce you have it, run mage.exe -cc and check again.\r\n\r\nSorry this is so much trouble - I'm working to figure out why the uninstall erred like this.",
